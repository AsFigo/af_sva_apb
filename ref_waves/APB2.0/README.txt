Welcome to Go2UVM's Waves2UVM app examples
------------------------------------------

This directory contains JSON files for ARM's AMBA APB 2.0 specification.

Each file corresponds to the Figure number as found in APB2.0 specification

These JSON files are intended to serve as an example of application of
Waves2UVM app as part of Go2UVM - www.go2uvm.org

Each json file can be viewed as SVG/PNG at WaveDrom.com site (SVG files are
saved here for easy access as well).

Each of these JSON file can also be converted into a UVM trace with
VerifWorks's (http://www.verifworks.com) Waves2UVM app.

To run Waves2UVM app, run Perl app at:

$VW_GO2UVM_HOME/apps/VW_Waves_2_UVM_app/perl_src/vw_dvc_wd_apps.pl
