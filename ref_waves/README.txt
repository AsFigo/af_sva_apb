Welcome to Go2UVM's Waves2UVM app examples
------------------------------------------

This directory contains several JSON files for sample protocols

These JSON files are intended to serve as an example of application of
Waves2UVM app as part of Go2UVM - www.go2uvm.org

Each json file can be viewed as SVG/PNG at WaveDrom.com site (SVG files are
saved here for easy access as well).

Each of these JSON file can also be converted into a UVM trace with
VerifWorks's (http://www.verifworks.com) Waves2UVM app.

To run Waves2UVM app, run Perl app at:

$VW_GO2UVM_HOME/apps/VW_Waves_2_UVM_app/perl_src/vw_dvc_wd_apps.pl
